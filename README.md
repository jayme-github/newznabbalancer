newznabbalancer
===============

Do you use different Newznab sites indexing same or similar content and only giving a hand full of API hits/grabs a day? This little balacer allows you to auto-change to the next indexer if your grabs or hits exeed on the first one.

Should work with all Newznab sites and all Newznab clients (like Sickbeard and Couchpotato).
